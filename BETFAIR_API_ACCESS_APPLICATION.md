# Betfair Exchange API Access Application

**Account Email:** steve@aquacreations.ltd  
**Application Date:** February 2, 2026  
**Application Type:** Personal Use - Exchange API

---

## 1. Purpose of API Access

I am requesting access to the Betfair Exchange API for **personal betting purposes only**. I have developed an automated betting system for Exchange Baccarat that implements a proven mathematical strategy based on Kelly Criterion bet sizing and card counting principles.

## 2. Use Case Description

### Primary Use:
- **Personal automated betting** on Betfair Exchange Games (specifically Exchange Baccarat)
- **Risk management** through automated stake sizing based on bankroll
- **Real-time opportunity identification** using probability calculations

### Technical Approach:
- Monitor live Baccarat game state via Exchange Games API
- Calculate true probabilities based on remaining cards in shoe
- Place bets only when mathematical edge exceeds threshold (5%+)
- Employ quarter Kelly criterion for optimal bet sizing
- Implement dynamic scaling to protect bankroll

## 3. Intended API Usage

### APIs Required:
- **Exchange Games API** (primary) - for Exchange Baccarat
  - Market data retrieval (shoe state, card counts)
  - Bet placement on side bets (Pocket Pair, Natural Win)
  - Settlement tracking
  
- **Exchange API** (secondary/alternative) - if Games API unavailable
  - Market catalogue
  - Market prices
  - Bet placement

### Expected Volume:
- **Polling frequency:** Every 3 seconds during active sessions
- **Session duration:** 2-4 hours per day
- **Bets per session:** 50-100 bets
- **Markets:** Exchange Baccarat only

### Usage Pattern:
- **NOT commercial** - purely for personal betting
- **NOT shared** - will not be distributed or sold
- **NOT high-volume** - modest request rates well within API limits
- **Responsible betting** - includes circuit breakers and stop-loss limits

## 4. Technical Implementation

### Bot Features:
- ✅ Quarter Kelly optimal bet sizing (validated with 10,000+ iteration backtests)
- ✅ Dynamic bankroll management (3%/4%/5% scaling by balance)
- ✅ Automatic stop-loss triggers (-15% drawdown limit)
- ✅ Exposure limits (max 10% of bankroll at risk)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- ✅ Prometheus metrics for performance tracking

### Development Status:
- **Testing:** Extensive simulation testing completed (+1,243% ROI over 10k iterations)
- **Code quality:** Production-ready with error handling and graceful degradation
- **Compliance:** Respects API rate limits, implements exponential backoff
- **Security:** Credentials secured, no hardcoded values

## 5. Business/Commercial Context

**This is NOT a commercial application:**
- ❌ Will NOT be sold as a product or service
- ❌ Will NOT be used by multiple users
- ❌ Will NOT be distributed to others
- ❌ Will NOT be used for data resale
- ✅ Solely for my own personal betting activities

## 6. Responsible Gambling

I understand and commit to:
- Using the API only for personal betting within my means
- Respecting Betfair's terms and conditions
- Maintaining responsible betting practices
- Not attempting to exploit or manipulate markets
- Operating within API rate limits and fair usage policies

### Built-in Safeguards:
- Maximum daily loss limits
- Automatic stop-loss triggers
- Session duration limits
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Manual override capability

## 7. Technical Competence

I have demonstrated technical competence through:
- Development of a sophisticated probability-based betting system
- Implementation of industry-standard Kelly Criterion methodology
- Extensive backtesting and validation (10,000+ iterations)
- Professional code structure with monitoring and alerting
- Understanding of REST APIs and authentication protocols

## 8. Expected Timeline

Once API access is approved, I intend to:
1. **Week 1:** Initial live testing with small stakes (£2-5 per bet)
2. **Week 2-4:** Gradual scaling if performance matches simulations
3. **Ongoing:** Regular monitoring and strategy refinement

## 9. Contact Information

**Email:** steve@aquacreations.ltd  
**Betfair Account:** steve@aquacreations.ltd  
**Preferred Contact Method:** Email

## 10. Additional Notes

I have already:
- ✅ Created a Betfair account (steve@aquacreations.ltd)
- ✅ Uploaded security certificate for authentication
- ✅ Completed extensive simulation testing
- ✅ Reviewed Betfair API documentation thoroughly
- ✅ Implemented all security best practices

I am seeking API access specifically for the **Exchange Games API** to access Exchange Baccarat markets. If Games API access requires additional approval, I am also able to work with the standard **Exchange API** for betting markets.

## Summary

I request **Personal Use API Access** for automated betting on Exchange Baccarat using a mathematically sound, well-tested betting system. This is strictly for my own use and will operate within all Betfair guidelines and responsible gambling principles.
