Subject: Exchange Games API - Ready to Use (Confirmation)

Dear Betfair Developer Support,

I'm writing to confirm I'm ready to use the Exchange Games API for personal betting.

Account email: steve@aquacreations.ltd

Setup Status:
✅ Games API authentication implemented (per v1.142 User Guide)
✅ Terms & Conditions accepted on games.betfair.com
✅ Bot tested in simulation mode (10,000+ iterations)
✅ Ready for live testing with small stakes

Intended usage (personal only)
- Automated betting for my own account (non-commercial; not distributed; no data resale)
- Conservative request rate (polling ~every 3 seconds during active sessions)
- Responsible gambling controls (exposure limits, stop-loss/circuit-breakers, manual override)

Questions
1) Can you enable Developer/API access for my account so I can create a Delayed Application Key?
2) Is Exchange Games API access available for personal use, and if so what additional approval is required?

I’ve attached a short application overview with technical details and safeguards.

Kind regards,
Steve
